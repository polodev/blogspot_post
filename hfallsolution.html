<p>before you continue first I am going to introduce you some glossary </p>
<p><strong>Alopecia Areata :</strong>  This is kind of mistake of your immune system. Your immune system believe your hair follicle is kind of intruder. so its attacks your hair follicle in order to save you. So your hair follicle became shrinkage and slowly slowly became dead. Its happen after any big illness.</p>
<p><strong>DHT : </strong>This is the main villain for your male pattern baldness. You are a Grown man. In order to make you a grown man your body produce testosterone. As by products some times it produce DHT(Di hydro testosterone) roughly 5%. This is actually hereditary problem. some of dht covered your hair follicle eventually hair follicle became shrinkage >>> dead.  So If you control it you can  reverse your hair D):</p>
<p><strong>dandruff :</strong>I know you know about dandruff. </p>

<p><strong>Hair fall :</strong>Its very common to loose 50 -100 hair every day. when you loose a hair with in a short period of time new hair start growing from your that hair follicle. But if follicle became shrinkage or dead then its hard to regrow hair from this follicle</p>
<h2>Big Talk</h2>
<p>I know you heard about Castor oil. its really good for your hair. What you can do put some Castor oil in scalp. leave it overnight or 3 ~ 4 hours then wash your hair with shampoo. Now another thing comes up Shampoo. Since its a daily commodity you should purchase shampoo with your hair fall consideration. Himalaya anti Hair fall Shampoo is good. Alternative could be L'Oreal Paris 6 Oil Nourish Shampoo , Arnica shampoo. You should go with such kind of shampoo which actually increase the blood flow in your scalp. Now another thing comes up Blood flow. Hair follicle getting nourished from Blood flow. Its connected with  blood. You will get lot of shampoo in market which have ingredients  like Arnica, Bringaraj, amla which increase blood flow in your scalp ... so key note is [use herbal shampoo with hair fall prevention]. Weekly one or two day you should use anti dandruff shampoo[Head & Shoulder]. Another important tool for increasing blood flow is derma roller. You will get it in amazon. first go with .5mm derma roller. Apply at least once in a week use derma roller in your hair. </p>
<p>Now bad side for castor oil >> Its good for my hair but it actually very thicker. Felling boring  when applying on scalp. Very next day I am not getting motivated to use on scalp again. But You have to use this oil at least 2 days in a week. You may heard about Jamaican Black castor oil(JBCO). You will find lot of good review out there. So instead of using normal castor oil you should use JBCO. Do you think JBCO its pure castor oil. Not really it actually contain roasted castor seed so its became black. its better than castor oil. Lot of people already get benefit from it to getting their hair line. Mostly women. </p>
<p>your mother and sister may use coconut oil but you didn't use coconut oil in your scalp. If this is case(in my case) You made a mistake. Coconut oil preserve your scalp protein. which makes your hair shiny and healthy. Coconut hair oil has lot of saturated fatty acid & lauric acid. So start using organic coconut oil . which actually nourish hair follicle. Do you know if you drink coconut oil daily it can boost your brain and immune system. If you eat this it will also kill bad pathogen in your gut because it has lauric acid. so eat organic coconut oil daily. search on google. Earlier science discover if people eat saturated fatty acid which found in coconut oil it will cause heart diseases. Now people find it was bad science. People became more healthier those who take coconut oil orally. Anyway never take those type of coconut oil which only made for hair. You should take extra virgin coconut oil / organic coconut oil. if you live in india pure and sure coconut oil is good.</p>
<p>Lot of people using olive oil for moisturizing their skin. Its best man. Believe me. It has deep penetrating characteristics. It can go deeper in your skin via skin pore. It has lot of properties which help you to reverse your hair or at least it will keep your hair line. Best things about Olive oil is Its partially DHT blocker. So if you facing male pattern baldness or any other hair fall this will be best alternative. Its not thicker like castor oil. You will love this. I am using olive oil every day. Its reliable, comfortable and effective treatment. You are busy. You don't have time to think which day you will castor oil, which day coconut oil, which day Bringaraj oil. In this case use only olive oil. You certainly will be happy. If you are indian you can go with soulflower olive oil. they are the best.</p>
<p>Bringaraj oil. you heard this word just now or before. Its also have anti hair fall properties. lot of people using in india. Its describe in Ayurveda. </p>
<p>You heard about essential oil. some essential oil really help you to reverse your hair. 4 essential oil you need to start this hair fall battle. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Lavendar Oil</li>
	<li>Jojoba Oil</li>
	<li>Rosemary Oil</li>
	<li>Grape Seed Oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Those essential oil stimulate hair growth and increase hair density and keep you calm. If you go through every oil benefits you will find all (4) oil  has such kind of properties which will help you to reverse your hair and control your hair fall. you should not use essential oil directly on your scalp. This is because essential oil is volatile. If you don't know about volatile, volatile means it will evaporating rapidly I mean it won't be liquid for long time. It will mix with air. So you need carrier oil. Carrier oil means which will accompany your essential oil. You can chose 1 out of 4. olive oil, coconut oil, Bringaraj oil, Castor oil. Or you can combine olive-coconut. Bringaraj Oil would be good since it has anti hair fall characteristics. But olive oil has deep conditioning characteristics. So if you use olive oil as carrier oil it will reach essential oil to the follicle. I mean it will work as tourist guide!!. Plus it has own healing power. I personally not like castor oil because its thicker and using on scalp is uncomfortable. But once a week is ok. If you are in India go with soulflower brand for essential oil or carrier oil. outside India go with Now brand(lot of good brand out there research).</p>
<p>Do you ever heard about emu oil. Emu is a Australian bird. It actually for meat *****. Emu oil collected from emu fat. 70% of emu oil is essential fatty acid. It has better deep penetration characteristics. It can go very deeper through your skin pore. so if you use essential oil with emu oil this will be best alternative. your follicle get nourished from fatty acid & essential oil. some days you can use emu oil and castor oil together. I have read lot of good review about combine using emu oil and castor oil. Here is the best things about emu oil is Its DHT blocker. which is important for male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>So far I told which oil you should use in your scalp at night time How about day. What should you put in day time. you can use those oil in day time also if you not go outside. But you are working some where so you don't want put oil @ day time. in this case you can use very little olive oil using finger tips I hope it won't be look sticky. If you are in India you can use Himalaya anti hair fall cream. Its working great for day time looks. your hair will be look thicker. plus in long run it will stimulate hair growth and increase hair density.</p>
<p>So best combination could be for night (gist of the state above) :</p>
<ul>
	<li>combinationOne : emu oil + 4 essential oil [lavender, rosemary, jojoba, grapeseed]</li>
	<li>combinationTwo : olive oil + 4 essential oil [lavender, rosemary, jojoba, grapeseed]</li>

	<li>combinationFive : bringaras oil + 4 essential oil [lavender, rosemary, jojoba, grapeseed]</li>
	<li>weekly one days : emuoil + castor oil + bringaraj</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you use oil in your hair. Here is the things you should know. Never put oil in your hair. put oil in your scalp. take oil in left hand palm. dip your right hand finger tips in left hand palm oil. now using your right hand finger tips use oil on your scalp. You will find its takes very less oil to cover your whole scalp. Those Oil are costly specially emu oil D):</p>
<p>for day use Himalaya anti hair fall cream or little olive oil </p>
